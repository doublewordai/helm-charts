# For our internal cluster we only use Stable as we want to have a single channel for all the bundles. Add new versions to this channel
# freely to test them out. Once they are production ready, migrate them to the production file ./operator_catalog_prod.yaml initially in 
# the fast channel and then once confident in its performance to the stable channel.
